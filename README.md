Alfresco Android SDK
====================

Alfresco Android SDK allows developers to access Alfresco functionality, both on-premise and the Cloud, from Android using a simple API. It will also allow “hybrid platform” vendors such as Appcelerator and Trigger.io to provide the same functionality via their plug-in mechanisms giving access to non-native, HTML5 focused developers.

The API supports connecting to all types of Alfresco repository, from 3.4.x on-premise servers to the Cloud using Alfresco Public API.
